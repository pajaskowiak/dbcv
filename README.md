# DBCV
Density-Based Clustering Validation

This is the source code employed to compute DBCV (Density-Based Clustering Validation) in our following paper:

*Density-Based Clustering Validation. Davoud Moulavi, Pablo A. Jaskowiak, Ricardo J. G. B. Campello, Arthur Zimek, and JÃ¶rg Sander. Proceedings of the 2014 SIAM International Conference on Data Mining (SDM). 2014, 839-847*

The Matlab source code from this repository is from Davoud Moulavi and Pablo A. Jaskowiak.

You can also find an implementation of DBCV in the R Package [clusterConfusion](https://github.com/pajaskowiak/clusterConfusion).
