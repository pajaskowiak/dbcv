This is the source code employed to compute DBCV (Density-Based Clustering Validation) in our following paper:

The Matlab source code from this repository is from [Davoud Moulavi](https://scholar.google.com.br/citations?user=VoJmF8QAAAAJ) and [Pablo A. Jaskowiak](https://scholar.google.com.br/citations?user=by6xRbkAAAAJ). 

## Usage

For calculating the DBCV Validation Index of a partition run dbcv.m. The output of the function is the DBCV index for the corresponding partition. Its values are within -1 and +1. DBCV is a *maximization* index, which means that higher values correspond to better partitions, according to the index. The necessary inputs are the dataset (without labels) and the partition, which correspond to a clustering solution, that is, labels. The dataset should be formatted with each line corresponding to an object, with columns corresponding to features. The partition is a 1-dimensional array with cluster assignments, in integer format. The number of labels must match the number of objects in the dataset. 

**Important note**: noise is represented by label 0 (zero). Therefore, any object with label of zero in the partition is considered as noise. By definition, singletons (clusters with a single object) will be treated as noise by the measure (please see the paper for discussion on this topic).


### Example: Computing DBCV on a Synthetic Dataset

Assuming you are running Matlab and your current working directory is *src*.

```
%first we load the dataset
load ../data/dataset_1.txt

%we run dbcv on the dataset (first two columns),
%passing its ground truth as partition (column 3).
val = dbcv(dataset_1(:,-3),dataset_1(:,3))

%val should be 0.6149. Note that this is low given
%that some noise points actually overlap the clusters.

%we can also plot the dataset with the following
plot_clusters(dataset_1(:,1:2),dataset_1(:,3))

%that's all :)
```


## Datasets

In the folder *data* you can find the four synthetic datasets employed in our paper. These are shown below. Plots in PDF and PNG can be found in the folder *plots*. Please, if you use any of these datasets in a publication, cite *both* our paper and this repository.

## Disclaimer 

This prototype was developed for research purposes only. It was *by no means* implemented to optimize computational performance. Therefore, its computational performance should not be evaluated and/or fairly compared to that of other measures.
